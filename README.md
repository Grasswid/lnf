    <p>She wore blue velvet, Bluer than velvet were her eyes, Warmer than May, her tender sighs, Love was ours
        Ours a love I held tightly<br>
        Feeling the rapture grow
        Like a flame burning brightly
        But when she left, gone was the glow of Blue velvet
        But in my heart there'll always be<br>
        Precious and warm a memory
        Through the years
        And I still can see blue velvet through my tears</p>

        <li>I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to <em>thinking</em> that I thought
            Maybe I'd get less <em>stressed</em><br> if I was tested less like
            All of these debutantes
            Smiling for miles in pink dresses <br> and high heels on white yachts
            <em>But I'm not, baby, I'm not
                No, I'm not, that, I'm not.</em>

                24/7 Sylvia Plath<br>
                Writing in blood on my walls
                'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad<br>
                Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
                But at best, I can say I'm not sad <br>

            Doesn't have a problem <br>
            Lyin' to herself
            'Cause her liquor's top shelf<br>
            It's alarming, honestly
            How charming she can be<br>
            Fooling everyone
            Telling 'em she's having fun</li>
        <li>She says, "You don't want to be like me<br>
            Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
            I'm dyin', I'm dyin'<br>
            She says, "You don't want to get this way<br>
            Famous and dumb at an early age
            Lyin', I'm lyin"</li>
        <li>The boys, the girls
            They all like Carmen<br>
            She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes<br>
            She laughs like God
            Her mind's like a diamond<br>
            Audiotune lies
            She's still shinin'<br>
            Like lightning, whoa, whoa
